# Migrating Web Applications to Azure 

## Session Abstract
When Tailwind Traders acquired Northwind earlier this year, they decided to consolidate their on-premises applications with Tailwind Traders' current applications running on Azure. Their goal: vastly simplify the complexity that comes with an on-premises installation.

In this session, you'll examine how a cloud architecture frees you up to focus on your applications, instead of your infrastructure. Then, you'll see the options to "lift and shift" a web application to Azure, including: how to deploy, manage, monitor, and backup both a Node.js and .NET Core API, using Virtual Machines and Azure App Service.

### Deployment

Almost all sessions can be performed from a trial Azure subscription. Instructions for configuring the subscription with specific assets such as Virtual Machines and resource groups can be found in the Demo/Lab instructions document linked above, often in the form of a script that can be run from Cloud Shell. 

- [Instructions and prerequisites are outlined here](deployment.md).
